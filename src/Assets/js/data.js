        his
        hellp. Michael explain for me web devlopment is very easy way possible from html
        to
        react and through his help my carrier in web development is like a breezy. For
        me
        it's like he know almost everything because whenever I ask him, there's always
        postive feedback for my question. He learn everyday and make sure he stregthen
        his
        weakness. If you want to learn coding whether from scratch or intermediate I
        prefer
        him.`,

    review: `Skill is potrayed by humanity and kindness, Michael doesn't treat 
    people with difference regardless of background or culture, he treat based
     on content of their character these few years we have been together we learned
      a lot from each other and can't stop. If you need a mazing worker who only can't
       provide quality but care about every part of it. this is the person. He's amazing 
       in what he does. `,
